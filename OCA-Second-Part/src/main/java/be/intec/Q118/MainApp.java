        Which three are advantages of the Java exception mechanism?
A. Improves the program structure because the error handling code is separated from the normal program function
B. Provides a set of standard exceptions that covers all the possible errors
C. Improves the program structure because the programmer can choose where to handle exceptions
D. Improves the program structure because exceptions must be handled in the method in which they occurred
E. Allows the creation of new exceptions that are tailored to the particular program being created


A C E: Itâ€™s not D, because exceptions may be handled later and not where they occurred.
And its E, because we can create our custom exceptions by extending de base exception classes.
